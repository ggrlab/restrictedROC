restrictedROC calculates restricted ROC curves, their permutation p-values, plots and multivariate random forest models with restriction.

## Installation

You can install the latest version of restrictedROC like so:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ggrlab/restrictedROC")
```

## Quickstart

Given a dataset with one dependent (outcome, binary) variable and one independent 
(predictor, numeric) variables, e.g. the value of a biomarker in two groups of patients,
we want to know if the biomarker is informative for the outcome.

```{r}
set.seed(123)
biodata <- data.frame(
    outcome = factor(c(rep("Good", 50), rep("Poor", 50))),
    biomarker = c(rnorm(50, 10, 3), rnorm(50, 9, 1))
)
head(biodata)
```
Here we use ``outcome`` and ``biomarker`` as dependent and independent variables, respectively. 
``outcome`` is a factor with two levels, ``biomarker`` is a numeric variable.

The most convenient usage of restrictedROC is via the ``rROC()`` function.
The most important results of 
``restrictedROC::rROC()`` are:

- (restricted) AUCs for all possible cutoffs of the predictor variable
- A global and maximal (including all restrictions) AUC
- Permutation p-values for the global and maximal AUC


```{r}
# library(restrictedROC)
set.seed(412)
res_rroc <- restrictedROC::rROC(
    x = biodata$biomarker,
    y = biodata$outcome,
    positive_label = "Good",
    n_permutations = 100 # increase that in real data!
)
```
``res_rroc`` is a nested list where the first level contains all dependent variables (Here only ``y``). The second level contains the results for each independent variable (here only ``x``).

Each dependent + independent variable combination has the following results:

 - ``plots``: Plots, only if enabled, otherwise NA
 - ``permutation``: A ``restrictedROC`` class element containing each permutation result
```{r}
single_result <- res_rroc[["y"]][["x"]][["permutation"]]
```

Given a dataframe, you can use arbitrary dependent and independent variables (within the dataframe) 
and calculate the restricted ROC curve for each combination. Additionally, the list 
names will be set to the respective dependent (first level) and independent 
(second level) variable names. 

```{r}
set.seed(412)
res_rroc <- restrictedROC::rROC(
    x = biodata,
    dependent_vars = c("outcome"),
    independent_vars = c("biomarker"),
    positive_label = "Good",
    n_permutations = 100 # increase that in real data!
)
```
```{r}
single_result <- res_rroc[["outcome"]][["biomarker"]][["permutation"]]
```

``single_result$permutation_pval`` refers to the permutation p-values of:

- ``pval.twoside.global``: The global AUC when all samples are used. This is the usually known AUC with a calculated permutation p-value.
- ``pval.twoside.max``: This is the maximal (restricted or unrestricted) AUC's permutation p-value. 

```{r}
print(round(single_result$permutation_pval, 3))
```
In this particular example we see that at a significance level of 0.05, the global AUC is insignificant, but the maximal AUC is significant. 
This tells that the data should be restricted and has a 
**limited informative range**. 


``single_result$global`` refers to the AUC, its variance under H0, the standardized AUC, 
and its (asymptotic, not permutation!) p-value when using all samples without restriction.
```{r}
print(single_result$global)
```
We see that the AUC is 0.6016, with a p-value of 0.08. This is not significant at a
significance level of 0.05. 

``single_result$max_total`` refers to the AUC, its variance under H0, the standardized AUC, 
its (asymptotic, not permutation!) p-value, the threshold(=restriction value) and which 
part of the data is **kept** and therefore **within the informative range**. 
```{r}
print(single_result$max_total)
```
In this example, the maximal AUC is 0.9089, with a restriction value of 9.377944 and a 
focus on the "low" part. Therefore, the informative range is ``biomarker < 9.378``.

In particular, we observe that the AUC is much higher than the global AUC, and that the
p-value is lower. This is because the data is restricted to the informative range 
and the AUC is calculated only on the samples with values within this range. 


We have a convenient way to visualize the data and the results:
```{r, out.width="50%"}
grouped_data <- split(biodata$biomarker, biodata$outcome)
png("man/figures/example.png", width = 800, height = 800, res = 120)
print(
    restrictedROC::plot_density_rROC_empirical(
        values_grouped = grouped_data,
        positive_label = "Good"
    )
)
dev.off()
```
![aSAH rROC example](man/figures/example.png)


``plot_density_rROC_empirical()`` effectively: 
    1. Calls ``simple_rROC`` to perform restriction
    2. Makes the results readable with ``simple_rROC_interpret()``
    3. Plots the original data and the restriction results
